# Back Jumping Algorithms for solving CSP

Algorithms Implemented:
* Gashnig's Back Jumping (gbj.py)
* Graph Based Back Jumping (gbbj.py)
* Conflict Directed Back Jumping (cbj.py)

Above python files expect JSON representation of a CSP

## How to run?

* Clone the repository
* Run below commands:
```bash
python gbj.py inputs/validatorInput.json
python gbbj.py inputs/validatorInput.json
python cbj.py inputs/validatorInput.json
```
